# Convert a resume jSON file into HTML code

## :book: How to use

This is an application that converts a resume file into HTML code.
Once you put a JSON file in the root, the `js/json_to_html.js`converts it into HTML code.
You can see the resume on the browser and print it as well.

## :warning: Note

You need to convert your resume into a JSON file in advance. Then, name the file `resume.json` and put it in the root.<br>
Here is [an example of the structure of a JSON file](https://github.com/marieooq/resume_json_html/blob/master/resume.json).

## :thumbsup: What I worked on

- Used CSS custom properties <br>
  I used CSS custom properties instead of other CSS libraries, to make it easy to modify the style even later.

- Adjusted the size of the page so that you can print the resume <br>
  I set the size of the page in the CSS file so it looks good when printed using the browser.
